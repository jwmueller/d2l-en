### Creating a Dataset for Machine Learning

Transforming data into format suitable for supervised learning, inner/outer joins, etc.
Ensuring IID.

### How Much Data is Enough

the O(1/\sqrt{m}) plot

Cramer Rao, learning theory and friends (for background)

### Data Splitting


Test vs validation data. Test data are sacred & should only be used for final evaluation

Validation strategies (leave-one-out, 10-fold, bayesian, frequentist, MDL, stratified-splitting, appropriately-sized validation set, etc.)

handling rare classes

reserving most recent data for validation in temporal settings where predictions will be on future data


### Inference Settings

Batch inference vs online inference applications

Incremental training

Transductive vs inductive learning
