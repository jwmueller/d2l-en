# Feature Engineering
:label:`sec_feature_engineering`

### Example of derived features

Representing date/time column via multiple features (year, month, day-of-week, cyclical features,  etc.)

### Scaling

### Binning

Also called quantization

### Alternatives to one-hot encoding

Thermometer code, etc.

### Edge-cases

dealing with previously-unseen categories, missing values (missing can be a feature vs. MCAR), etc.

### Feature Selection

Curse of dimensionality, filter vs wrapper methods (eg. removing features with no variation or User IDs).

### Representations to the Rescue

blah2vec, bert, kernels and beyond
