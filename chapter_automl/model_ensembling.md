# Model Ensembling
:label:`sec_model_ensembling`

Why ensembling helps (voting argument, demonstrating less correlated ensemble = superior)

Example of lack of identifiability with few data points


## Weighted Ensembling

### Ensemble-Selection

### Blending via Regression


## Stacking

Multi-layer stacking

Skip connections


## Bagging

Example: Decision tree vs Forest

Repeated bagging


### Multi-layer stacking with repeated bagging

Full algorithm, including time-limits


## Summary

Mention boosting and Bayesian methods were not covered here.
