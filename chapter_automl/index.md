# Automated Machine Learning
:label:`chap_automl`

Automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the promise of trans- lating raw data into accurate predictions with just a few lines of code. Rather than relying on human time/effort and manual experimentation, models can be improved by simply letting the AutoML system run for more time.

This chapter demonstrates fundamental techniques that enable powerful AutoML. We consider standard supervised learning tasks on various types of data including tables, text, images. Most of this code in this chapter is adopted from AutoGluon (`autogluon.mxnet.io`), a recent AutoML toolkit that is both state-of-the-art and easy-to-use. To date, most AutoML material has focused exclusively on the task of model/hyperparameter selection with tabular datasets and classical ML models. This chapter provides a broader perspective that also encompasses image/text data, automated deep learning, and other equally important aspects of the ML pipeline.
