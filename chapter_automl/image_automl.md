# AutoML for Image Data
:label:`sec_image_automl`

Describe differences from Tabular data setting:
* Models are all massive neural networks, transfer learning & data augmentation are key additions to ML pipeline.
* HPO becomes more important for these models which have tons of brittle hyperparameters.
* Neural Architecture Search may provide further boost if lots of compute + training-time available.
* Ensembling can be simply achieved via Deep Ensembles or checkpoint-based ensembles (like SWAG).


Demonstrate AutoGluon on small Shopee-IET dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-iet-mlchallenge).

Describe a few example pretrained models from GluonCV model-zoo.

Describe mixup as example of data augmentation.
