# Automating the ML Pipeline
:label:`sec_automating_pipeline`


## AutoGluon Example

Walk-through how AutoGluon’s fit() internally implements full ML Pipeline (Data Splitting, Data Preprocessing, Fitting individual models, Hyperparameter-Tuning, Model Selection/Ensembling), automatically selecting the appropriate techniques at each stage of the pipeline.

Enforcing time-limits

Skipping models upon failure


This tutorial does not delve into mathematical details of particular models but rather focuses on how to best utilize models within overall ML pipeline. For an accessible introduction to other models like trees/RF/GBM/KNN, check out chapters 8-12 of the textbook: “Hands-On Machine Learning with R” (https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/).
